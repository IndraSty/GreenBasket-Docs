# System Architecture

GreenBasket is an e-commerce application built with a monolithic architectural approach. 
In this architecture, all components are integrated in one common base code. 
Here are the main components and their associated features. GreenBasket uses the Go programming language (Golang) with the Gin framework. 
Go is an efficient, readable language, and suitable for web application development and using MongoDB as a database. 
MongoDB is a flexible NoSQL database suitable for applications with diverse data schemas. 

The external service used, Midtrans, is used as a payment gateway to process payment transactions. 
This service ensures safety and reliability during the payment process.  
GreenBasket implements OAuth2 authentication from Google and Facebook. Users can log in with their Google or Facebook accounts. 
There are two user roles: seller and customer. Sellers can manage products, orders, inventory, and view sales reports. 
Customers can view the product catalog, order products, leave reviews, and choose payment methods.

With a monolithic architecture, GreenBasket has a unified unit, facilitating development and maintenance. 
All components work together to provide a good experience for users.
