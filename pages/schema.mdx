# GreenBasket Database Schema

GreenBasket uses MongoDB as its database. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that does not require a rigid schema. 
You don't need to design the scheme in detail beforehand. This flexibility makes it possible to store and combine different types of data 
without strict restrictions. MongoDB provides high performance and good scalability. With the appropriate schema, it can be possible to 
access data quickly and manage large data growth.

The schema used in GreenBasket is a complex database schema with several collections that are interconnected. Some of the visible collections include Users, Sellers, Orders, Order Items, Products, Categories, Payments, Transactions, Templates, and Notifications. Each collection has various fields with specific data types.
